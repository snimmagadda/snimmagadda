### Hi,

I am a software engineer with 15 years of experience offering expertise in building secure, performant and scalable networking daemons, backend systems and general systems programming.

In my spare time I contribute to NetBSD, OpenBSD and related projects.

The engagement with my current employer concludes shortly and I am actively looking for new opportunities. Contact me via email at sunil+github@nimmagadda.net or via IRC handle `skn` on [libera.chat](https://libera.chat/).
